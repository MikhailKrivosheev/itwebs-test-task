        <p>
          To expedite the process of assessing your knowledge, we would like you to complete a test
          assignment, which will take a relatively short time.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are not interested in using the software you&apos;ve developed for commercial purposes,
          but rather in assessing your knowledge level.
        </p>
        <p>This position is suitable for Junior+/Middle-level developers.</p>
        <p>
          A little about us. We are a relatively new team in the market and are currently
          transitioning to a new level of operations. Our company policy is to give all employees
          more freedom in decision-making. In other words, we&apos;re not looking for just a
          developer who uses the knowledge they&apos;ve learned during their internship, but someone
          who can offer their own options and ideas, should they arise.
        </p>
        <p>Our work format is remote.</p>
        <p>
          Salary: discussed during the final call with management. Our calculation system is
          KPI-based, meaning salary depends on the employee&apos;s monthly workload.
        </p>
